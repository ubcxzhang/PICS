# PICS
Probabilistic inference of ChIP-Seq using an empirical Bayes mixture model approach. An R package developed for the ananlysis of the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. 

This is R implementation of statitical method proposed in my paper

Zhang, Xuekui, Gordon Robertson, Martin Krzywinski, Kaida Ning, Arnaud Droit, Steven Jones, and Raphael Gottardo. "PICS: probabilistic inference for ChIP‚Äêseq." Biometrics 67, no. 1 (2011): 151-163.

Please cite this paper, if you used this R package in your research. Thanks!

To install this R package, please use the following R code:

    library(devtools)
    install_github("ubcxzhang/PICS")

This is a clone of my Bioconductor package PICS version 2.28.0 https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/PING.html

So, this package can be installed from Bioconductor using  the following R code:

    if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
    BiocManager::install("PICS")
