CHANGES in VERSION 1.2
----------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o When plotting the FDR (i.e. plot(pics,picsC)) the number of enriched regions is also displayed as a function of the cutoff score at the top.

NEW FEATURES

    o Support for the multicore package. The number of cores will automatically be detected. The multicore package
    needs to be loaded for that.
    
    o Snowfall is still supported and if sfCluster() is called, snowfall will be used over multicore. So if you want to use snowfall make 
    sure not to load multicore
    

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed a bug when calculating the scores. The scores are now normalized for the 
    number of reads in the control. This could have affected the FDR calculation.

    o Added better documentation for the plotting methods. Typing ?plot or ?FDR should get you better documentation.
